title: "Our Story"

The R4DS Online Learning Community is a community of R learners at all skill levels working together to improve our skills.

We launched in August 2017 as a supportive and responsive online space for learners and mentors to gather and work through [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund[^story-1].

[^story-1]: They actually read the [first edition](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, but we recommend you stick with the more up-to-date 2e!

The group has grown from that initial club into a community of over 10,000 learners.

Stay tuned for links to talks we have given about our various projects!
