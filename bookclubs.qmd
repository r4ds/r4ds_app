title: "Book Clubs"
---

For more than four years, the **R4DS Online Learning Community** has organized weekly book clubs to help a diverse, friendly, and inclusive community of data science learners and practitioners achieve their learning goals. 
We started with a handful of nontraditional learners reading a single book together, and have grown to thousands of members, reading dozens of books in small, organized cohorts that meet every week. 
If thereâ€™s a free, online book (or website) covering a data-related topic that you would like to read, we invite you to join us to read it together!
