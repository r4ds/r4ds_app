### Projects:

#### [Mentoring Improvements](https://opencollective.com/r4ds/contribute/giving2023-mentoring-improvements-68464)

We provide [free data-question-answering](slack.html) on our Slack team via volunteer mentors.

We would like to make it easier for our mentors to answer questions by providing a streamlined web interface, and by matching new questions with previously answered questions.
This project will allow us to answer more questions faster.

#### [More-open Book Clubs](https://opencollective.com/r4ds/contribute/giving2023-more-open-book-clubs-68465)

We host book clubs for a wide range of data-related books, including [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.io/r4ds), [Python for Data Analysis](https://r4ds.io/py4da), and [R Packages](https://r4ds.io/rpkgs).
To join a book club, you must join our Slack team, and follow the associated channel.

We would like to open up our clubs to users who are not on our Slack.
This project will require software development to integrate our club management with additional login providers (such as Zoom, Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, and/or Mastodon), and to ensure that our meetings do not get spammed.

#### [TidyTuesday Dataset Search](https://opencollective.com/r4ds/contribute/giving2023-tidytuesday-dataset-search-68466)

We host a weekly social data project called [TidyTuesday](https://tidytues.day), where we share a new dataset each week and invite the data science community to explore it.
We have been posting new datasets every week since April of 2018, and we now have about 600 datasets available for download.

We would like to make it easier to search those datasets.
To do so, we will refactor the TidyTuesday GitHub repository, extend the [{ttmeta} package](https://github.com/r4ds/ttmeta), and build a Shiny search interface.

### Fine Print

-   We may not receive enough funding to complete any of the projects.
-   Your vote will help us prioritize the project list, but other priorities may arise that require our immediate attention.
