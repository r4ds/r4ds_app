title: "Sponsorship"

**TL;DR:**

-   **If you have the means to support data science education, [please donate before March 15](https://r4ds.io/donate)!**

Last fall, this Community became a fiscally sponsored collective within the [Open Collective Foundation (OCF)](https://opencollective.foundation/), a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. 
Up until then, I paid for everything myself â€“ our Zoom accounts, our domain names, experiments with other services like Zapier and IFTTT, even a workshop to learn tips and tricks for managing large, open-source projects. 
I wanted to see what this Community could become, so I spent what I had to spend.

I've used the tax-deductible donations we've received as a member of OCF to help me pay for web services, and I am extremely grateful to those of you who have been able to donate already. 
However, the existing donations will not cover our infrastructure forever, and this Community needs more than web services to operate.

I volunteer about 20 hours per week to keep this Community running, and I can't afford to keep up that unpaid labor forever. 
I would love to offer additional book clubs, to streamline the process for starting a new club, and to improve the materials used by those clubs. 
I would love to learn more about who uses TidyTuesday datasets and what they do with the data, and to make it easier for them to work with that data. 
I would love to continue to provide a friendly place for people to help one another with their data science questions. 
And I would love to offer additional services to help data science learners become data science professionals. 
We are actively seeking grants and other funding to make all of these things possible. 
But things have, unexpectedly, grown more urgent.

Last week, the Open Collective Foundation made the shocking announcement that they are dissolving. 
**We have less than two weeks to collect donations for the foreseeable future.** 
After March 15, we won't be able to accept donations until we are able to find a new sponsoring charity. 
It will be much easier to find a stable sponsor if we demonstrate an ability to support ourselves.

By design, most of our active members are just starting out on their data science journeys, and cannot yet afford to pay; that's a big part of why we exist. 
We need you to pay it forward. 
**If you have the means to support data science education, [please help us survive this transition by donating today](https://r4ds.io/donate).**

Thank you,
